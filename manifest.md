# Files
-necroplisgame.py
  - Main game script
  - inoperable without FinalGame.txt
-Finalgame.txt
  - Narrative file where all of the text responses from the NPC and game text can be found
  - additionally holds "stage directions" that were the framework for the main game code
-testingground.py
  - unneeded to run the game
  - My 'garbage code' file, where I found code from youtube, the Zelle book, and stackexhange and tested it to teach myself the various syntaxes needed for the script
  -readME.md
    - instructions for the game
    
### N.B.
- necropolisgame.py and Finalgame.txt just need to be in the same folder to run. They arent packaged together to avoid git branch merging nonsense and make sure the most recent versions are in the right place.
