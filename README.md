4. The entry is not case sensitive,and you can leave off the punctiation at the end of options, but entering invalid prompts will issue an error, if you get an error make sure your spelling is correct.

## Overview
- The code starts simply, with single text option prompts to get one used to the game
- From there it gets more complex, offering a choice of two options, a simple yes or no
- The final portion of the demo is a multiway choice, you may select any of the options in any order you chose, but opting to "leave" the conversation will end the demo
